# Nearest_Neigbour_Coulomb

Code to calculate magnetocurrent due to magnetic stray field and nearest neighbour Coulomb interactions.
The Coulomb interaction are taken in a mean-field theory.
The magnetic stray field causes a phases shift in the hopping of helical chain of atoms.

We use the non-equilbrium Green's function method in our calculations.

Finally, thank you for making it this far. It probably means you went deep into my thesis.
Please feel free to contact me when you have any questions.
