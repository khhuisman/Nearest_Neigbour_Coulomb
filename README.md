# Nearest_Neigbour_Coulomb

Code to calculate magnetocurrent due to magnetic stray field and nearest neighbour Coulomb interactions.
The Coulomb interaction are taken in a mean-field theory.
The magnetic stray field causes a phases shift in the hopping of helical chain of atoms.

We use the non-equilbrium Green's function method in our calculations.

Finally, thank you for making it this far. It probably means you went deep into my thesis.
